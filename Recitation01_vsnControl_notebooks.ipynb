        "\n",
        "Keeping with the \"Document everything you do\" mentality, you need to start thinking about how to manage changes to your analysis or modelling projects early on. Imagine the following common situation. You have a working analysis script, but you decide to do additional analyses requested by your colleague/advisor/reviewer. You make the required changes, and while your new analysis works fine, suddenly you find that you can't replicate your previous analyses - they give you an error or results that differ from what you had before.\n",
        "\n",
        "This happens surprisingly often. One way to deal with that is to always backup your scripts, and make the changes to new files. While this may work for the simplest of cases, it becomes unwieldy quickly and you can end up with 10 versions of your analyses at which point you are in a no better situation than you were before, because you have to figure out which script contains the version of the code you need. If you work collaboratively on the same analyses, this becomes even more problematic."

One is provided when you install git, but a much better one comes with GitHub, which has a familiar user-interface that allows you to just point-and-click to the most common options. The command-line tool is more versatile, and I recommend learning how to use it, but the end goal is to get the job done, and if you prefer to use the app, go ahead.\n",

Let's say that you have just spent some time revising your analysis script by changing the regression model you are using. You can commit your new changes with the commit command.

You can work on multiple versions/branches of your project at the same time. Your main branch is called **master**. It is automatically created when you initialize a repository and unless you create other branches, it will be the only one. At any point in time, you will always be in a certain branch, and any changes you make to your files at that time will only be made to files in that branch. When you create a new branch, you make a copy of the branch from which you created it. Importantly, this does not actually copy your files, and if you go into your project folder you will not see anything different at that point. Once you've made and commit any changes, you can switch between branches. Any time you switch to a branch, the files in your folder will be replaced with the files corresponding to the last changes in the branch. You can also merge branches together, implementing changes from one branch into another.\n",

In this setup, you never work in your master branch - you always make changes in the development branch and once you are satisfied with those changes, you merge them into your master branch. That allows you to easily switch between your current in-progress changes and your last working version of your script in your master branch.\n",

        "You've finished making your changes on your development  branch (called **dev**), you have tested them, and you want to finalize them. You need to merge your *dev* branch with your *master*. Any time you merge two branches together, git compares their contents, checks for conflicts and combines any changes made in the different branches. In the simplest case, where you've only made changes to one of the branches, it will just replace the files in the other with the newer version. If, you've made changes to the same file under different branches, it will try to merge them. If the changes are about different parts of the file, it will combine them with no problem most of the time. If the changes are to the same lines in a file, it will create a conflict error that you will have to resolve manually. For now, just avoid doing that, and let's assume you've made changes only to one branch. When you merge branches, you implement the changes in whatever branch you are currently in.
